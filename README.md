  ### 👩‍💻 Hi, I’m Ginalva ( you can call me by Luana too)! <br>
  I graduated at Human Resources, but I fell in love with tech and now I look for an opportunity to start a career as a Frontend dev.
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development, design and UX/UI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need a hand at CSS (for now...).
- 📫 You can reach at g.lunascime@gmail.com or my LinkedIn profile.
